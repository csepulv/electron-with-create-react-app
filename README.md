Code repo for [my post on freeCodeCamp](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/building-an-electron-application-with-create-react-app-97945861647c#.ze6c9qin1).

There is another branch, [npm-start](https://github.com/csepulv/electron-with-create-react-app/tree/npm-start)
It uses `npm-start` instead of `npm run dev`. (change submitted by [vcarl](https://github.com/vcarl)) Details are in this [pull request](https://github.com/csepulv/electron-with-create-react-app/pull/2)
