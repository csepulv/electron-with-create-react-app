## Overview

Welcome to the future of application development! This project is aimed to provide developers with skeleton code to create robust cross-platform desktop applications using [Electron](https://electron.atom.io/), [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/), [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), and [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/). 

Check out the [Getting Started](https://github.com/1-14x0r/electron-react-semantic-ui-app/wiki/Getting-Started) guide if you would like to learn how this project was created from the ground up. Basic knowledge of how to [install](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and use [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/getting-started-guide/) is required. It is also a good idea to familiar yourself with the [Electron](https://electron.atom.io/docs/tutorial/quick-start/) toolkit.

### Pre-Requistes
- Text Editor such as [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/) or [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) - [download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) - [download](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)

## Quick Start
- clone project into a directory
- navigate into project directory
- run 'node install' in the console
- wait..
- run 'npm start' or 'yarn start'
- electron applicaiton should display after a short time

You can change the port number that the development server runs on for hot code deployment (auto refresh code changes) in the .env file located in the root of the project.

Edit app.js located in your ./src directory to start coding! GLHF<3
